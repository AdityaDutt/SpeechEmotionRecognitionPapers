## Introduction
I gathered these resources for my Ph.D. literature review. In this curated list of papers, I have focused on speech emotion recognition, multi-modal emotion recognition (text + face + speech), and ethics in emotion recognition. I am starting the review based on these papers, but I will keep expanding the list. Feel free to contact me if I have missed some papers.

My personal interests in SER include natural speech generation conditioned on emotion. The state-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) deep learning models like Tacotron and Wavenet generate natural speech by conditioning speech on spectrograms/mel-spectrograms of a particular voice. Similarly, they can be conditioned on spectrograms of a particular emotion to synthesize a more lifelike voice. I am also interested in using emotion detection in speech recognition. It can help virtual assistants to understand users better when the meaning of their words is ambiguous. Lastly, it is useful in monitoring people’s emotional states to identify suspicious behavior at public places like airports.

There are a few other applications of Speech Emotion Recognition. It is being used in gaming to improve players’ experience. Gaming companies are substantially investing in Emotion AI using eye-tracking, facial coding, and voice analysis to recognize and interpret human emotions. It can also be used to better help patients with psychological disorders and psychiatric counseling.

Annette Zimmermann, the renowned Gartner analyst, stated - “By 2022, your personal device will know more about your emotional state than your own family.” Emotion AI is rapidly advancing. According to Gartner, ten percent of personal devices worldwide will possess Emotion AI features on-device or via cloud services by 2022.
